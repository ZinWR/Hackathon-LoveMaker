Download the zip file and extract. Go to Chrome Extension Store and upload the file (including the manifest.json). Pin the extension and click to generate pickup lines.

## Lesson & Impact
- I learned about using the APIs and how to use the fetch method via GET/POST to send and receive requests from the client to the server.
